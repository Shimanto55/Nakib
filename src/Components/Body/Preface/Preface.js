          On the current wave of growing business expansion and the booming
          economic development across the globe, Bangladesh can in no way be
          thought of and of course is not beyond the process. Whatever might be
          the exact calculation and the ground reality in the distribution of
          wealth and development, there is nothing to deny that banking and
          other financial institutions are playing a pivotal role in boosting
          the economic growth and keeping it up in line with the current
          phenomena involving all the stakeholders from farmers in the rural
          area to influential businessmen in the capital. Pertinently, dealings
          in businesses inevitably generate complexities between the
          organizations and their clients that require a meaningful solution
          through legal process. To that end, having due regard to the demands
          and requirements of our esteemed clients, we have taken strains on our
          shoulders and accordingly have equipped our firm with experienced and
          efficient legal professionals having an in-depth understanding and
          requisite expertise in providing our clients with the services they
          need for both litigation and documentation.
          <br />
          <br />
          NAKIB & ASSOCIATES is a new generation law chamber offering legal
          services mainly to Bank and financial institutions. The broad-based
          popularity of the firm is for its unique and efficient service
          delivery to its valued clients. Principally, we are concentrated on
          serving corporate clients so as to let them feel comforts and
          conveniences leaving their headache on us to settle them in the best
          possible means. Other than the corporate clients, our areas of
          practice also revolve around other issues such as writ, civil,
          criminal, service matter, company matter, arbitration, admiralty
          jurisdiction and the list is set to continue. Therefore, our clients
          range from individuals and government institutions to corporate as
          well. <br /> <br />
          <span className="moreText">
          One of the cardinal features of the firm that attract our clients is
          experience, in-depth understanding and skill of blending between facts
          and law coupled with a sense of professionalism. They are so kind
          because we believe that most of the lawyers working with the firm have
          got their education and training from the reputed law
          schools/universities inside and outside Bangladesh. Further, they have
          gathered experiences and skills working in the leading law-firms. Our
          people are also experienced in vetting documents on title, agreements
          and contracts, verifying documents in the sub-registry offices,
          assisting in the registration formalities, obtaining license from the
          concerned institutions/organizations. This is not the least that our
          people are from varied backgrounds and therefore it has been easy for
          us to bring together a unique system uniting international expertise
          and domestic requirements that our clients do expect.
          <br /> <br />
          The firm equally treats all of its clients; individuals or corporate,
          national or international and feels satisfaction to serve all of them
          in a professional manner with proven commitment and sincerity. In
          addition to the banks, we are also serving other financial
          institutions. Alongside the clients we have been working for, NAKIB &
          ASSOCIATES is in the way of stepping into other avenues of the
          corporate sector including the non-banking financial companies, large
          national and international corporations. <br /> <br />
          The firm, NAKIB & ASSOCIATES, is centered on delivering quick and
          efficient services, possibly with the highest level of care, quality
          and perfection to its clients. We would also like to urge that ours is
          a law-firm that cares for its clients most and is ready over the clock
          to cater services on legal issues of any kind that help us garner
          complete reliance of clients on us.
